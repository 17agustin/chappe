**Developer Docs builder. Write guides in Markdown and references in API Blueprint. Comes with a built-in search engine.**

Chappe is a Developer Docs builder, that produces static assets. No runtime, just lightweight static files. It was built to address SaaS companies needs, and can serve as a first-class modern alternative to services such as [ReadMe](https://readme.com/).

The reason behind why we made Chappe is the following: while looking for a Developer Docs builder at Crisp, all that we could find were either outdated open-source projects, or commercial documentation builders. We wanted a modern Developer Docs website hosted on our premises, as pure-static assets (the latter is especially important, as we do not want to rely on a plethora of external services that can go down anytime).

**Using Chappe is as easy as:**

1. Writing all your docs in Markdown;
2. Building your docs in a single command;
3. Finally, deploying static build assets to your Web servers (or GitHub Pages, Cloudflare Pages, etc.);

_üëâ Did you know that you could automate step 2 and 3 with GitHub Actions? Push your changes, and watch them be automatically deployed live._

**üáµüá™ Crafted in Lima, Peru.**

## Screenshots & Demo

**üëâ See a live demo of Chappe on [Crisp Developer Hub](https://docs.crisp.chat/).**

1Ô∏è‚É£ Chappe can generate your REST API references:

2Ô∏è‚É£ It also generates Markdown-based developer guides:

3Ô∏è‚É£ Oh, and it also lets your users search anything in your Developer Docs:

_üëâ Note that the search engine feature is local. This means that it does not run on an external service like [Algolia](https://www.algolia.com/), though it provides similar search performance and results. The search index is generated at build time as a JSON file, which gets loaded on-demand when the search box gets opened._
