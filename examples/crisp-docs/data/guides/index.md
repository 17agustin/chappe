**ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to the Crisp Developer Hub!** We have written extensive guides to help you build powerful integrations with Crisp. This ranges from our chatbox, our REST API and RTM API, Web Hooks to plugins.

Guides are classified in categories, for each system available to you. Aside from guides, you may also find references. References are more technical, as they serve as full specifications of our systems. You may want to use guides and references aside, switching between both of them.
